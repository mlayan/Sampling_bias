# Impact and mitigation of reporting bias on phylogeography inference 

Passive surveillance systems are suspected to report infectious disease cases in a biased way by overrepresenting cases from urban and administratively important areas at the expense of rural and lowly populated areas, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Biased reporting might have an impact on modelling predictions as well as phylogeography inference. To test the potential impact of spatial bias on phylogeography inference, 
1. We simulated realistic rabies epidemics among domestic dog populations in Morocco using a stochastic metapopulation model
2. Whole-genome rabies virus sequences of the complete epidemics were simulated using a simple HKY model
3. Rabies virus sequences were sampled uniformly, in a biased way or in a way to mitigate the bias effects   
4. The spatiotemporal history of rabies epidemics were infered by the DTA and MASCOT models implemented in BEAST based on sequence alignments
5. Inferred and simulated migration histories were compared in biased and unbiased scenarios
